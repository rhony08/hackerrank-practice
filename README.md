## Note
I made this repository from my hackerrank practice. Each of file included its url problem (if you want to try). If you think the code still need improvement, feel free to comment it.

Since all of this are from hackerrank problem, I just focusly create on solution function. Does not change default function (main function and others). So hopefully you understand that this code only to complete the challenge, not to adjust and fix its existing code. So you can focus on its solving function (which has multiline comment).
